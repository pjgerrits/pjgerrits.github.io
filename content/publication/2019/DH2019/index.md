abstract: This research introduces a novel geo-spatial sampling model to overcome
  a major difficulty in historical economic geography of Bulgarian lands during a
  crucial period; immediately before and after the de facto independence of the territory
  from the Ottoman Empire in the second half of the nineteenth century. At its core
  it seeks to investigate the research question how the Bulgarian independence affected
  agricultural production in two regions (centered around the cities of Plovdiv and
  Ruse) of today's Bulgaria, for which there are conflicting yet empirically unsubstantiated
  claims concerning the economic impact of the political independence. Using our be-spoke
  geo-sampling strategy we believe, we have sampled regionally representative commensurable
  agricultural data from the 1840s Ottoman archival documentation, in accord with
  agricultural censuses conducted by the nascent nation state of Bulgaria in the 1890s.
summary: This research introduces a novel geo-spatial sampling model to overcome a
  major difficulty in historical economic geography of Bulgarian lands during a crucial
  period.
