Hello and welcome to my personal website. I am interested in a wide range of digital and geospatial methods in the fields of History, Cultural Heritage  and archaeology. I was first introduced to geospatial studies during my undergraduate and graduate studies in archaeology and have been broadening my horizon in several research projects ever since. Currently I am working as a full-time member in the UrbanOccupationsOETR ERC-Funded Research Project at Ko√ß University.
