Hello and welcome to my personal website! Here you can find more information about my ongoing academic research. 
My main academic interest is in the use of <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__geospatial data science__* </span> and computational applications in <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__digital humanities, cultural heritage management and archaeology.__* </span>

I was first introduced to the significant role of geospatial applications in 2011, during my undergraduate at the <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__Vrije Universiteit and Wageningen University__* </span> in the Netherlands. Afterwards, I obtained my graduate degree at <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__Koç Unversity__* </span> in Istanbul, where I utilized my technical skills to help document and analyse Turkey's rich history and archaeological cultural heritage, from modern times to the Neolithic. 

Over the years I have broadened and diversified my skills and interests by *teaching* <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__GIS (Geographic Information Systems)__* </span> in archaeology and history, *organize* <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__summer schools,__* </span> *work in several* <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__research projects,__* </span> as well as by *participating in a* <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__ERASMUS+ capacity building project__* </span> in Kufa, Iraq. 

Most recently, I have been employed as a full-time lead geospatial data scientist and  Research Fellow in an <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__ERC-Funded Horizon 2020 Research Project__* </span> [(UrbanOccupationsOETR)](https://urbanoccupations.ku.edu.tr/) at Koç University. Here, I developed the geographic content management system of the project, as well as working on research projects that incorporate <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__Computer Vision/Machine Learning__* </span> for feature extraction of Historical Maps, <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__Network Analysis__* </span> and the use of <span style="color: #4caf50;"> *__geospatial mobile survey applications__* </span> for academic public outreach activities.
