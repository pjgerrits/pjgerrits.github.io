<figcaption>
Below depicts a fully functional 2.5D model as well as a digital elevation model of  Barcın Höyük. This model was created for the Barcın Höyük excavation symposium in 2016. It is based on top and bottom elevations of excavated contexts, during 7 years of the project. 
The model was created by using ArcScene, CityEngine Webviewer and runs on OpenGL. <a href="https://bit.ly/3bRYrxG">Open the full viewer</a> for better controls and guidelines.</figcaption>
